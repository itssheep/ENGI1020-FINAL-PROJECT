This is my project for Engineering 1020: Introduction to Programming. It is a simple infinite scroller-Dino game which I put together over several weeks. 
The code is probably unoptimized and slow, but this was my first ever project, which placed in the top 8 of the class.
A grove beginner arduino is required, but if you would like to view the playable game without having one, remove anything that has to do with the engi1020 module or the separate script which handles the arduino movements.
Thank you.
